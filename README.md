# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in Java

## Overview
This repository is a dedicated chronicle of my journey to learn and master Data Structures and Algorithms using Java.  
The primary goal is to gradually build a strong, practical foundation in these core computer science principles, essential for software engineering roles and competitive programming.  
Each implementation is intended to be clear, efficient, and well-documented.

## My Approach
- **Clarity Over Cleverness:** The code is written to be easily understood, with meaningful variable names and a logical flow.  
- **Efficiency Matters:** Each algorithm and data structure will include notes on time and space complexity (Big O notation) as I implement them.  
- **Javadoc Documentation:** Every method will be documented with Javadoc comments, explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values.

## Data Structures
This repository will include implementations of core data structures as I progress:  
- Arrays: Dynamic resizing, basic operations (insert, delete, search), multi-dimensional arrays.  
- Linked Lists: Singly, Doubly, and Circular lists. Traversal, insertion, deletion, and reversal.  
- Stack: LIFO principle, implemented using arrays and linked lists.  
- Queue: FIFO principle, implemented using linked lists and circular queues.  
- Hash Table: Hashing functions, collision resolution (chaining, open addressing), key-value mapping.  
- Trees: Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees. Traversal methods (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order).  
- Heaps: Min-Heap, Max-Heap, implemented as Priority Queues. Heapify, insert, extract operations.  
- Graphs: Representation using Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List, basic graph theory.  
- Tries: Prefix trees for efficient string searching and storage.

## Algorithms
The repository will cover fundamental algorithms as I implement them:

**Sorting:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.  
**Searching:** Linear Search, Binary Search.  
**Graph Traversal:** Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS).  

This structure will help keep implementations organized and easy to navigate as the repository grows.

## Future Goals
- Explore advanced topics like Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and Greedy Algorithms.  
- Solve problems from platforms like LeetCode and CodeChef to apply these concepts.  
- Add comprehensive unit tests for each data structure and algorithm to ensure correctness and robustness.
